  <a name="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Game Description</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to set sail.  You must command a pirate crew through the grand seas. You and your crew have  craving for some gold. You decide to venture into the oceans, to look for the  loot. It will be a dangerous adventure, filled with monsters, pirates,  treasures and more. Be careful, be bold, and try not to dieâ€¦ </p>
<h3> <a name="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to Play</h3>
<p>You command a pirate  ship with crew. Your goal is to get as many treasures as you can before you  die. Death comes if you lose all of your ships integrity (health points), you  have no more crew members, or run out of ale (fuel) for traveling. You must  travel to islands to begin a quest event. Make the best decision you can, and  hopefully come out on top. Avoid the enemy pirates! They are after the same  treasures you are. If they get close to you, a battle will begin and you must  destroy them. This can hurt so avoid doing so. Once you have your fill of  quests in an area, travel to the lighthouse to enter the next level. As you  progress to higher levels, enemy ships will become ever stronger. </p>
<h3> <a name="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ship Stats: Resources</h3>
<p>Resources are found on  the bottom left display. They are crucial to keeping afloat. </p>
<p><strong>Ship Integrity </strong> <br>
Your ship&rsquo;s health. If  it reaches zero, game is over. </p>
<p><strong>Crew Members</strong> <br>
  Your mateys. Again, if  this reaches zero, game over. </p>
<p><strong>Ale</strong> <br>
  This is your ship&rsquo;s  fuel. If this reaches zero, game over. </p>
<p><strong>Gun Powder</strong> <br>
  You need gunpowder to  shoot cannons. Without any gunpowder, you are a sitting duck during batltles. </p>
<p><strong>Treasure</strong> <br>
  The prize! Every  pirate&rsquo;s ultimate goal. This is your score. Try to get a high number! </p>
<h3> <a name="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ship Stats: Attributes</h3>
<p>Attributes boost your  ship. They do an assortment of things and generally help with quests, traveling  and battles. </p>
<p><strong>Morale</strong> <br>
  Higher morale will  reduce ale cost for traveling. </p>
<p><strong>Evil</strong> <br>
  Higher evil increases the  distance of battle bar stoppers. </p>
<p><strong>Charisma</strong> <br>
  Charisma gives you a  bonus of ship integrity at the start of a level </p>
<p><strong>Notoriety</strong> <br>
  Slows down the battle  slider during battle. </p>
<p><strong>Wit</strong> <br>
  Wit will give you a  bonus of gun powder at the start of a level </p>
<p></p>
<h3> <a name="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Enemies</h3>
<p>Enemy Pirate ships roam  the seas. They are on a constant look for loot and others to attack. Your best  bet is to avoid them at all costs. Battling enemies will only cause damage and  loss of resources. A good pirate would keep their distance and only fight when  necessary. Press spacebar while your bar is between the two sliders (on top).  Pressing spacebar at the right time will cause the enemy ship to explode! </p>
<p></p>
<h3> <a name="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Island Quests</h3>
<p>Your ultimate goal of  treasure is reached by going to islands and starting quests. They will give you  a choice to make, and they can either be advantageous to the player or harmful.  Depending on your ship stats, the quests success rate differs. You must think  about the choice to make, depending on your ship stats, and hope for the best.  Once all or most island quests are depleted, it is time to move to the  lighthouse and enter the next level. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3> <a name="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LightHouse</h3>
<p>Reach the lighthouse to  get to the next level. It might be a good idea to only go to the next level  once you have checked out most or all islands on the current level. The areas  will get harder with each level increment, so best of luck and get as many  treasures as you can! </p>
